  <h1>My personal site</h1>
  <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 64)"> The first site in perfect broken English, beware of imitations!</p>

  You are probably wondering why this site is so shitty: it is pure html[5]. I'm anything but an artist :D</br>

  I'm hosted with GitHub Pages (at the moment, if they don't kick me out! Why would they tho?! ;D).</br>
